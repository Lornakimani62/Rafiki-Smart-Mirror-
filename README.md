# Magic-Mirror
# Application
**MagicMirror** is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the **MagicMirror** allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. 
MagicMirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!

# Automatic Installation (Raspberry Pi only!)

*Electron*, the app wrapper around MagicMirror², only supports the Raspberry Pi 2/3. The Raspberry Pi 0/1 is currently **not** supported. If you want to run this on a Raspberry Pi 1, use the [server only](#server-only) feature and setup a fullscreen browser yourself.


# Manual Installation

1. Download and install the latest *Node.js* version:
- `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
- `sudo apt install -y nodejs`
2. Clone the repository and check out the master branch: `git clone https://github.com/Lornakimani62/Rafiki-Smart-Mirror-.git`
3. Enter the repository: `cd MagicMirror/`
4. Install and run the app with: `npm install && npm start` \
   For **Server Only** use: `npm install && node serveronly` .


**:warning: Important!**

- **The installation step for `npm install` will take a very long time**, often with little or no terminal response! \
  For the RPi3 this is **~10** minutes and for the Rpi2 **~25** minutes. \
  Do not interrupt or you risk getting a :broken_heart: by Raspberry Jam.


Also note that:

- `npm start` does **not** work via SSH. But you can use `DISPLAY=:0 nohup npm start &` instead. \
  This starts the mirror on the remote display.
- If you want to debug on Raspberry Pi you can use `npm start dev` which will start MM with *Dev Tools* enabled.
- To access toolbar menu when in mirror mode, hit `ALT` key.
- To toggle the (web) `Developer Tools` from mirror mode, use `CTRL-SHIFT-I` or `ALT` and select `View`.


# Server Only

In some cases, you want to start the application without an actual app window. In this case, you can start MagicMirror² in server only mode by manually running `node serveronly` or using Docker. This will start the server, after which you can open the application in your browser of choice. Detailed description below.

**Important:** Make sure that you whitelist the interface/ip (`ipWhitelist`) in the server config where you want the client to connect to, otherwise it will not be allowed to connect to the server. You also need to set the local host `address` field to `0.0.0.0` in order for the RPi to listen on all interfaces and not only `localhost` (default).

```javascript
var config = {
	address: "0.0.0.0",	// default is "localhost"
	port: 8080,		// default
	ipWhitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:172.17.0.1"], // default -- need to add your IP here
	...
};
```

# Client Only

This is when you already have a server running remotely and want your RPi to connect as a standalone client to this instance, to show the MM from the server. Then from your RPi, you run it with: `node clientonly --address 192.168.1.5 --port 8080`. (Specify the ip address and port number of the server)


### General

1. Copy `/home/pi/MagicMirror/config/config.js.sample` to `/home/pi/MagicMirror/config/config.js`. \
   **Note:** If you used the installer script. This step is already done for you.

2. Modify your required settings. \
   Note: You'll can check your configuration running `npm run config:check` in `/home/pi/MagicMirror`.


The following properties can be configured:

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `port` | The port on which the MagicMirror² server will run on. The default value is `8080`. |
| `address` | The *interface* ip address on which to accept connections. The default is `localhost`, which would prevent exposing the built-in webserver to machines on the local network. To expose it to other machines, use: `0.0.0.0`. |
| `ipWhitelist` | The list of IPs from which you are allowed to access the MagicMirror². The default value is `["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1"]`, which is from `localhost` only. Add your IP when needed. You can also specify IP ranges with subnet masks (`["127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.1/24"]`) or directly with (`["127.0.0.1", ["192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.100"]]`). Set `[]` to allow all IP addresses. For more information see: [follow post ipWhitelist HowTo](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/1326/ipwhitelist-howto) |
| `zoom` | This allows to scale the mirror contents with a given zoom factor. The default value is `1.0`|
| `language` | The language of the interface. (Note: Not all elements will be localized.) Possible values are `en`, `nl`, `ru`, `fr`, etc., but the default value is `en`. |
| `timeFormat` | The form of time notation that will be used. Possible values are `12` or `24`. The default is `24`. |
| `units` | The units that will be used in the default weather modules. Possible values are `metric` or `imperial`. The default is `metric`. |
| `modules` | An array of active modules. **The array must contain objects. See the next table below for more information.** |
| `electronOptions` | An optional array of Electron (browser) options. This allows configuration of e.g. the browser screen size and position (example: `electronOptions: { fullscreen: false, width: 800, height: 600 }`). Kiosk mode can be enabled by setting `kiosk: true`, `autoHideMenuBar: false` and `fullscreen: false`. More options can be found [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md). |
| `customCss` | The path of the `custom.css` stylesheet. The default is `css/custom.css`. |

Module configuration:

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `module` | The name of the module. This can also contain the subfolder. Valid examples include `clock`, `default/calendar` and `custommodules/mymodule`. |
| `position` | The location of the module in which the module will be loaded. Possible values are `top_bar`, `top_left`, `top_center`, `top_right`, `upper_third`, `middle_center`, `lower_third`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_center`, `bottom_right`, `bottom_bar`, `fullscreen_above`, and `fullscreen_below`. This field is optional but most modules require this field to set. Check the documentation of the module for more information. Multiple modules with the same position will be ordered based on the order in the configuration file. |
| `classes` | Additional classes which are passed to the module. The field is optional. |
| `header` | To display a header text above the module, add the header property. This field is optional. |
| `disabled` | Set disabled to `true` to skip creating the module. This field is optional. |
| `config` | An object with the module configuration properties. Check the documentation of the module for more information. This field is optional, unless the module requires extra configuration. |

## Modules

## Updating

If you want to update your MagicMirror² to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your Magic Mirror folder and type the following command:

```bash
git pull && npm install
```

If you changed nothing more than the config or the modules, this should work without any problems.
Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, git pull should be possible.


Please keep the following in mind:

- **Bug Reports**:  Make sure you're running the latest version. If the issue(s) still persist: please open a clearly documented issue with a clear title.
- **Minor Bug Fixes**: Please send a pull request with a clear explanation of the issue or a link to the issue it solves.
- **Major Bug Fixes**: please discuss your approach in an GitHub issue before you start to alter a big part of the code.
- **New Features**: please please discuss in a GitHub issue before you start to alter a big part of the code. Without discussion upfront, the pull request will not be accepted / merged.
